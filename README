The project was originally intended to be a growing collection of crypto modules for the Arduino platform. The commits in this repository
were used in a student project that was part of the authors Ph.D. work, but there has been limited to no time to work on this for the last 10 years obviously.

ACrypto -- the Arduino Crypto Library -- v. 0.9 (alpha -- prerelase - dec 2011)
==============================================================================

The ACrypto library is a collection of open-source code which implements
various cryptographic operations on the Arduino family of experimentation 
boards.

The code is released under GPL v3 license and comes with absolutely no
warranty. See the GPL v3 license agreement for details.
The authors have found the code useful in their projects and
we hope it will be of use to the Arduino community as well.

The library is located under lib/ACrypto. See INSTALL on instructions on
how to include the crypto functions in your projects.
